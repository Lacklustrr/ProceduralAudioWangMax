Blueprint used to trigger two separate soundscape systems. 
One populated with sample based metasounds. The other to populate with procedurally metasounds. 

Procedural map and Sample based map use the same audio gameplay volumes, with the same IR verb. 

Working on a procedural and sample based bow pull for the arrow based on bow pull distance param. 

Cannons will remain a constant in both maps. 

Fire distance blending is sample based only right now. 

Sfx to have sample and procedural versions as of now: 

-bow pull and fire
-fire distance blend 
-ambience (wind, insects, birds, trees)
